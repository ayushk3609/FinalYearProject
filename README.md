As we know that today with the fussy messy busy schedule of ours we in general are neither getting enough time to buy things nor do we have lots and lots of time to choose the best product. So basically we are in a trap where time is directly proportional to the quality of product we receive.
Thus to solve this problem and to avoid wandering around those busy busting streets, I have decided to make an E-commercial website which would save efforts choosing right products within no time just through some scrolls and some clicks, a user can easily have the best product out in the market into their home. I know the major problem is the security, No need to worry, there will be a secure payment gateway to ensure there are no vulnerabilities with user’s “most important information”.
The user would be provided a sign-in page so that it would be easier to maintain records of their cart history.
They would be given an option to save products in a wish list. There would also be a rating option available for all products so that user could get to know about other person’s buying experiences. So in a summary there would be all features one user can be comfortable with, along with :- Authentication, Payment gateways, Add or remove a product to or from the CART.
Please use following IDs for logging and testing as Retailer and Customer and Product published by retail to check CRUD operation.
Role                                          Login ID                Password              Product published
